# Weather-App

In this project, I made a very simple Weather App which takes name of location from the user and thus returns the temperature, description of weather, humidity, and wind speed of the location.
I used HTML for the basic outlook of the Webpage; CSS for the styling; and Javascript for the logics used.

HTML part is quite easy to understand as it only contains links of other pages and some Div containers.

CSS used is basic. Eg: used to define margins, borders, colors of the elements and positioning.

JavaScript uses Async-await system to fetch the API. API as well as its key used, is taken from OpenWeatherMap API which provides daily access to weather all round the globe.
